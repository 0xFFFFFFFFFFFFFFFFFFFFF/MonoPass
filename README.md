#### Description:<br>
MonoPass is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. Its an open source one-stop-catch-all password manager. It has handy features such as making Backups(In the cloud or external...), database encryption, and Random password generator! You can also customize its look with different Theme styles (To be implemented... :D). 
<br><br>
There will also be many more features and add-ons to come, this is only a Beta build! I also would like to hear feedback from you guys on things you would like to see happen in future builds, dont be afraid to comment!!
<br><br>
There is a ToDo List you can also check for some ideas :smile:
